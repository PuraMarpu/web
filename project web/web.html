                            camels have long eyelashes to protect their eyes from the sandy winds in the desert.

                        <li>
                            camels have a hump in their back which is amde up of lots of fats and water,
                             thus they can survive for a longer time in the desert.

                        <li>
                            camels have broader sole which reduces the pressure on the sand 
                            and helps them in easily walking in the sand.

                           Chameleons have a peculiar ability to change their skin color according to their surrounding
                           to hide from their predators and preys.

                            Each eye of the chameleon can move independently and hence view objects separately.
