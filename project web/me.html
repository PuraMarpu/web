                Origami.....<br>
                my father was somebody who taught me about it.<br>
                It seemed like a distant art, within my grasp but still far from me. 
                So i want to try my best to make this a memorable website.<br>

                The wonders that one can perform by just the folding and flipping the paper 
                are more than one could imagine.<br>
                And i know a least about origami, and this has helped me a lot,
                 so thank you anyone who visited this website and once again...<br>
